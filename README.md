Data is more powerful when we share it with others! And so I decided to create a dashboard showing off the climate/weather analysis I had done in a previous project. The link to that repo is: https://github.com/PreethikaG/OpenWeatherMap-API-Visualizations. To achieve this I used HTML and CSS.


In building this dashboard, I created individual pages for each plot and a means by which we can navigate between them. These pages will contain the visualizations and their corresponding explanations. I also added a landing or home page, a page where we can see a comparison of all of the plots, and another page where we can view the data used to build them.

# Website Design - 

Link to the website is here: https://preethikag.github.io/Web-Design-Web-Visualization-Dashboard-/


The website consists of 7 pages total, including:

* A Landing/Home page containing:
  * An explanation of the project.
  * Links to each visualizations page.

* Four Visualization pages, each with:
  * A descriptive title and heading tag.
  * The plot/visualization itself for the selected comparison.
  * A paragraph describing the plot and its significance.

* A  Comparisons page that:
  * Contains all of the visualizations on the same page so we can easily visually compare them.
  * Uses a bootstrap grid for the visualizations.
    
* A "Data" page that:
  * Displays a responsive table containing the data used in the visualizations. 

The website must, at the top of every page, has a navigation menu that:

* Has the name of the site on the left of the nav which allows users to return to the landing page from any page.
* Contains a dropdown on the right of the navbar named "Plots" which provides links to each individual visualization page.
* Provides two more links on the right: "Comparisons" which links to the comparisons page, and "Data" which links to the data page.
